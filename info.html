    <h2>site info</h2>
    <p>this site developed for desktop screen sizes first. some pages may look a lil wonky on mobile devices!</p>
    <p>
      source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/clairefreehafer/webbed-site" target="_blank">github</a>. this is a project for my enjoyment first and foremost, which means many aspects of it are not optimized for things like size and speed. some parts may load slowly. :) and other things may be totally unstyled (like this page).
    </p>
    <p>
      my goal is to keep this site as simple as possible, tech-wise, which means no javascript and/or css frameworks. i am also not using npm and any of its associated resources. in the future i may try to build out some of these things myself as a learning exercise, or decide it is worth it for a particular feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      a big part of this site is for displaying my photography, video game screenshots, and other digital art. it is my intention to include alt-text on all images, however there will probably be some missing. at some point i'll have a script that will tell me exactly which ones still need it so i can easily fill those holes.
